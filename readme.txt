Modules to install:
	pickle, numpy, pillow. All can be downloaded via "pip install %s" % moduleName.
Check that these files are in the same folder before running:
	"finalized_model.sav", "testDrawImage.png", "CreatedLevels.txt"
	The .sav file was sent in a separate email because it was too large for autolab.
While running:
	Click the help button on the start screen for rules and an example.
	To play click either "play created levels" or "start".
	While playing press either the number keys or use the drawing function for input.
	A separate window for drawing will pop up where you will draw your digit. Close it out and press Save to continue.
	There is an undo button to undo a move (backspace has the same functionality).
	Press the hint button to get the next number in the answer.
